## Queries the bot can answer
This bot was made to help passengers book flights. It has it's own database that consists cities, flights and other related details for India. We will release the structure of database soon. But, to test the bot you can ask it the following queries -

Type 1 - hello show me flights from mumbai to pune.

Type 2 - hello can you give me minimum fare for flights from nagpur to pune in the business class

Type 3 - hello can you give me air india flights from nagpur to pune

Type 4 - show me details for flight with id 9

Type 6 - hello how many seats are available for flights from nagpur to pune

Currently the bot is trained only on these 6 typed of queries and its variations. You can ask variations of the queries in natural language. Try to see in what scenarios the bot is not able to undertand you.

## How to run
Just run the 'Virtual_assistant_notebook.ipynb' notebook in the main folder of this repository in Colab.

1. Start executing all the cells one by one.

2. When you execute the last cell, it will automatically start recording your voice. When this happens you will see a button that says 'Recording' and you have to say your query at this point.

3. After you are done saying your query, you need to click the button to stop the recording.

4. The bot will show the results of your query and generate an animated face video with it's voice.
